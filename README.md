```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now the database for the project has to be initialized. This can be done with flask:
```
flask --app homebase init-db
```
The command above may take a few minutes to complete. It will have been completed successfully if you see this message in your terminal
```
Initialized the database.
```

Now the project can be run with the following command:
```
flask --app homebase run
```
If this command was successful you should see something like this in the terminal:
```
  * Serving Flask app 'homebase'

WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
  * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
Press CTRL+C to quit
```
Now go to your browser and type localhost:5000/ in the url bar

You should now be able to navigate the application with the following endpoints:

```

When you want to turn off the application, click on your terminal and press:
```
